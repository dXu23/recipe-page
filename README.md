<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./recipe.jpg)

- Where can I see your demo?

Right [here](https://coldfix.dev/dev-challenges/recipe-page/recipe.html).

- What was your experience?

I thought it was difficult since I had to create a clock svg and a knife
and spoon svg. 

- What have you learned/improved?

I learned how to create SVGs with a text editor.

- Your wisdom? :)

Use Google Material Icons or some library of some SVGs instead of making SVGs
yourself if you can.

### Built With

HTML, CSS, and SVG.

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/TtUjDt19eIHxNQ4n5jps) was to build an application to complete the following user stories:

- [x] User story: I can see a recipe with ingredients and instructions
- [x] User story: I can select a checkbox if I have the ingredients
- [x] User story: I can see the number of servings, baking times
